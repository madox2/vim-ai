## Installation

vim-ai requires Vim/Neovim compiled with python3 support and the [openai-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) library (version 0.27+).

```sh
# configure openai api key https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
echo "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" > ~/.config/openai.token

# alternatively using environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

Add plugin to your `.vimrc` using `vim-plug`:

```vim
" ./install.sh script will automatically install openai-python
Plug 'madox2/vim-ai', { 'do': './install.sh' }
```

Alternatively, you can install manually like so:
```
git clone https://github.com/madox2/vim-ai/
mv vim-ai ~/.config/nvim/plugin/  # this is an example, use your own appropriate path
```

## Usage

### :AI

`:AI` - complete the text on the current line

`:AI {prompt}` - complete the prompt

`(visual selection) :AI` - complete the selection

`(visual selection) :AI {instruction}` - complete the selection using the instruction

### :AIEdit

`(visual selection)? :AIEdit` - edit the current line or the selection

`(visual selection)? :AIEdit {instruction}` - edit the current line or the selection using the instruction

### :AIChat

`:AIChat` - continue or start a new conversation.

`(visual selection)? :AIChat {instruction}?` - start a new conversation given the selection, the instruction or both

Press `Ctrl-c` to cancel completion.

#### Custom conversation prompts

You can edit and save the conversation to an `.aichat` file and restore it later.
This allows you to create re-usable custom prompts. For example:

```
# ./refactoring-prompt.aichat

>>> system

You are a Clean Code expert, I have the following code, please refactor it in a more clean and concise way so that my colleagues can maintain the code more easily. Also, explain why you want to refactor the code so that I can add the explanation to the Pull Request.

>>> user

[attach code]

```

Supported chat roles are **`>>> system`**, **`>>> user`** and **`<<< assistant`**

### :AIRedo

`:AIRedo` - repeat last AI command

Use this immediately after `AI`/`AIEdit`/`AIChat` command in order to re-try or get an alternative completion.
Note that the randomness of responses heavily depends on the [`temperature`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-temperature) parameter.

## Configuration

### Key bindings

Map keys in your `.vimrc` to trigger `:AI` command.

```vim
" complete text on the current line or in visual selection
nnoremap <leader>a :AI<CR>
xnoremap <leader>a :AI<CR>

" edit text with a custom prompt
xnoremap <leader>s :AIEdit fix grammar and spelling<CR>
nnoremap <leader>s :AIEdit fix grammar and spelling<CR>

" trigger chat
xnoremap <leader>c :AIChat<CR>
nnoremap <leader>c :AIChat<CR>

" redo last AI command
nnoremap <leader>r :AIRedo<CR>
```

### Completion configuration

Request to the OpenAI API can be configured for each command.
To customize the default configuration, initialize the config variable with a selection of options.  For example:

```vim
let g:vim_ai_chat = {
\  "options": {
\    "model": "gpt-4",
\    "temperature": 0.2,
\  },
\}
```

Below are listed available options along with default values:

```vim
" :AI
" - https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions
let g:vim_ai_complete = {
\  "options": {
\    "model": "text-davinci-003",
\    "max_tokens": 1000,
\    "temperature": 0.1,
\    "request_timeout": 10,
\  },
\}

" :AIEdit
" - https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions
let g:vim_ai_edit = {
\  "options": {
\    "model": "text-davinci-003",
\    "max_tokens": 1000,
\    "temperature": 0.1,
\    "request_timeout": 10,
\  },
\}

" :AIChat
" - https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat
let g:vim_ai_chat = {
\  "options": {
\    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
\    "max_tokens": 1000,
\    "temperature": 1,
\    "request_timeout": 10,
\  },
\}
```

### Custom commands

To customize and re-use prompts it is useful to put some context in it. You can do it by prepending text to AI commands.

```vim
command! -range -nargs=? AITranslate <line1>,<line2>call AIEditRun(<range>, "Translate to English: " . <q-args>)

command! -range -nargs=? AICode <line1>,<line2>call AIRun(<range>, "Programming syntax is " . &filetype . ", " . <q-args>)

" available functions are: AIRun, AIEditRun, AIChatRun
```
